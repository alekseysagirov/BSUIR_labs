Some beautiful poem!
With two excl signs!
***********************************
The most beautiful poem!
It's cause it has three excl signs!
Jokes aside!
***********************************
Too serious poem.
It ends with comma.
Everytime.
***********************************
Some questioning poem?
Question everything?
***********************************
Some another poem!
Not so beautiful, but bigger!
Bigger means has more excl signs!
And more excl signs means it's gonna be picked!
